# AI-Assignment-2

## Task description

The task is to reproduce an image that is similar to the input image as a target image in an artistic way using Evolutionary algorithms.

## How to run the code:

In the submitted folder, there is one folder called ".idea" which is not necessary for compilation unless you are using an installed compiler idea such as Pycharm. In this Assignment, I used "JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2019.2 x64" For compitation. This folder contains 6 input images and 6 output images including the contest image. The following are the steps to run the code.

### Step 1: Open the main.py file
### Step 2: By default if you run, the "input 1.jpg" will run and the output will be named by default "output.jpg"
### Step 3: Wait till the execution ends and you'll get the result image.

## Additional comment: If you want to put your desired image, change line 7 in the "main.py" and add your filename. Make surte that it's included in the folder.
